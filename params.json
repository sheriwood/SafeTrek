{"name":"SafeTrek","tagline":"An application to find a safe walking or running route","body":"[Methods](https://github.com/sheriwood/SafeTrek/blob/master/Methods)## What is SafeTrek? \r\n<img src = \"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10748850/11568610/6baa31a6-99aa-11e5-85ac-18b859e2eee7.JPG\" width = \"200\"; height =\"175\" align = \"right\" padding-left = \"100px\"/> \r\nDo you want to take a stroll without worrying about running into dead ends or unsafe paths? Give SafeTrek your starting point and desired distance, and let it plan the rest. It will find the route with the most sidewalks and return you to your starting point.\r\n\r\n##How do I use it?\r\n<img src = \"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10748850/11570993/5c012e46-99b7-11e5-91e8-27a75a6f3e7d.jpg\" width = \"200\" height = \"175\" align = \"right\"/>\r\nSafeTrek is used much like the Google Maps navigator. Enter your starting point, but instead of an ending point (your ending point is your starting point), enter your desired distance. Your result will be drawn on a map, like the Google Maps navigator.\r\n\r\n##How does it work?\r\nSafeTrek finds streets and sidewalks in your area using OpenStreetMaps data. A routing engine is applied to the map, with safety and distance as key factors and a heuristic that tells the router how and when to return home. OpenStreetMaps is again used to display the result.\r\n\r\nCreated by Sheri Wood  \r\nNovember 22, 2015\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
