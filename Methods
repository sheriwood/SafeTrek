This doc will detail the search engine and heuristics, give the process used to obtain the maps and annotate them with the sidewalk data.

Map Data:
   I acquired map data by exporting an XML file for Logan, Utah from OpenStreetMaps. This data 
   an be exported for any region simply by entering the boundary coordinates at (TODO: enter 
   website here). Prior to doing this, I added sidewalk data by editing the public OpenStreetMaps map.
   
   The XML file is parsed into a graph, using the following steps:
   1. Elimiate all edges that are not roads (rivers, hiking trails, walkways, etc.).
   2. Assign a danger score to each edge based on the existance of a sidewalk (or lack thereof).
   3. Eliminate all nodes that are not intersections (buildings, other landmarks).
   4. Split up any edges that have more than two nodes, removing any nodes that do not branch from current edge.
   
Search Engine:
The search engine is a modification of the A Star search algorithm: 
   The heuristic is an error formula that tells the algorithm when to start heading back home.
   TODO: add error code
   With this error formula, the algorithm will choose nodes that move away from the start node 
   until the halfway point is reached. After that point, it will choose nodes that move closer 
   o the beginning, thus creating a loop that results in the desired distance.
   
   Differences:
   The input is a start point and distance rather than a start point and end point.
   The search is finished when the distance is reached or when there is no more search space.
